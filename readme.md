# CHECKER TO DO:
	-Check memoryleaks
	-Check that all mallocs are protected
	-Rename functions so that words are separated by an underscore
## push_swap
	-Exemptions ? If some integer of a chunk is too "expensive" it will be left behind in stack A and handled specifically when pushing from B to A.
	-Fix logical bug that causes stack B to be completely arranged in descending order
	-Check that all mallocs are protected
	-Rename functions so that words are separated by an underscore

## Last stuff
	-Norm the files
	-Move additional functions to new files
	-Check for dead code by commenting out functions and recompiling
